# RishiKumarHackathonManResa
Main Repository. For API/Database repo: https://github.com/NelfM/RishiKumarHackathonAPI-Database


REMEBER TO OPEN THE .xcworkspace file, not the .xcodeproj. 
Can't delete the .xcodeproj file, so sorry but the app will not function properly if the .xcodeproj file is run. This applies for both repositories

The way to access our project, is by clicking clone/download and pressing "Open in Xcode"
Then it will open the project file. To run the project, press the play button in the top left of the screen. It may take a few minutes, 
but it will launch a simulated iphone. After waiting a few moments, the app will automatically launch, and you can use it just like a
normal app on your phone.
